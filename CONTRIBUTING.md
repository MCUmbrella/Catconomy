# Contributing
To contribute to the code of the project just fork it and make a new branch, or if you are a maintainer make a new branch.

## Building the code
If you are new to gradle I'd recommend you import the code into inteliJ and then run it using this [guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-tasks.html#gradle_tasks).
